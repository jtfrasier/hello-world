# hello-world
My baby repository in an attempt to become github literate.
The date is 1/10/2020. 
This is the hopeful  beginning of a long journey to put myself in a position where I am proud
of my skills and what I've accomplished. I realized github was probably an important thing to understand,
and event though I've used it before, I never really understood how. So here we are, baby Johnny, attempting
to teach himself something new! It's exciting and I'm looking forward to starting all of the projects I've
had tucked away in my Notes. Stay tuned, folks.
